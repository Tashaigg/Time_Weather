# Time_Weather
Simple program shows time and weather, temperature and air quality in Santa Monica- MG Brazil.
Made with requests and tkinter.

To use it just save main.py and resquest_test.py in the same folder and open main.py

The weather will be updated every 15 seconds. If there is no connection it will not update. 

'Atualizado em' shows the last update for the weather. 

The background color for the weather is determinated by the air quality just as on the site accuweather.com.
